        <ol type="i">
            <li>In a pressure cooker, add the beef, water(ensure it covers all chunks of beef) and basel, rosemary and thyme leaves and cover to cook until a crackling voice is heard from the pot</li>
            <li>Once done, open the cooker, and drain any excess broth. Then add onions and some tallow oil and saute until golden brown in color</li>
            <li>Go in with your ginger and garlic once the onions have attained the desired color and cook these for about two minutes to get the flavors infused.</li>
            <li>Add your assorted seasoning spices and the blended tomatoes and cook down the acidity or until the oil starts to separate from the broth.</li>
            <li>Add in water to increase the stew content and let the meat simmer until the broth thickens</li>
            <li>(Optional) Add in some corn starch with your water to further thicken the broth.</li>
            <li>Once the stew has cooked down to a uniform consistency, add in the chopped corrainder and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Proceed to plate and serve the food.</li>
